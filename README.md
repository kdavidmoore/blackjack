# Blackjack

## A blackjack game created using HTML, CSS, and jQuery.

The player and the dealer are each dealt two cards, with a short pause between each card. The player can then decide whether to hit or stand. The game uses a simplified version of blackjack rules, e.g., Ace is always equal to 1.
